### Portfolio website with links to my projects and way to contact.   

The goal was to create a simple landing page for clients and employers to contact me.

## Lessons Learned 💭

Navigating the grid systems for the layout. Compressing images is important!

## Optimization ✅

When I improve the project, I would begin with making the contact form accessible. I would create a new hero image for the about me section.
